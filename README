Reproductive failure and lethal haplotypes
Deviations from expected Mendelian inheritance patterns may indicate reduced reproductive performance or the presence of lethal alleles. Advances in genomic markers have enabled more efficient investigation of such phenomena, including the identification of potential lethal alleles. These assessments can be performed using either SNP markers or haplotypes, with the latter being particularly useful for low- to medium-density genotypes (Abdalla et. al., 2020)
